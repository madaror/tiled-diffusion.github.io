# Tiled Diffusion

This repository contains the website for our paper "Tiled Diffusion," which has been accepted to CVPR 2025.

## About the Paper

Tiled Diffusion is a novel approach for generating seamlessly tileable images using diffusion models. Our method extends the capabilities of diffusion models to accommodate the generation of cohesive tiling patterns across various domains of image synthesis. It supports a wide range of tiling scenarios, from self-tiling to complex many-to-many connections, enabling seamless integration of multiple images.

Key applications include:
- Seamlessly tiling existing images
- Creating tileable textures
- Synthesizing 360Â° panoramic images
